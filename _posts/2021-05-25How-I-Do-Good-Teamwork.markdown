When it comes to programming and working with other people I do like to work with others when there's a really good communication around and helping the team wherever I can to keep the project working and fulfill the objectives, when working alone I do have a tendency to not be fast or simply not working well because I don't feel motivated or just simply being insecure about how my performance may not be optimal for the job, I feel like the best way to be productive is to have people around communicating, helping each other out and simply being good coworkers may achieve the goals and objective of any project.
